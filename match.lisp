;;; This is my cheap immitation of real pattern matching systems like
;;; match-s48, Erlang, Haskell etc.  A real pattern matching macro
;;; would expand to efficient inline decision code, but this isn't one
;;; of those systems, it just tests each pattern sequentially.  Ported
;;; from some old Emacs Lisp code I wrote years ago (wok-match.el).
;;;
;;; Usage:
;;;
;;; (match <object>
;;;   (<pattern>
;;;    <body> ...)
;;;   (<pattern>
;;;    <body> ...)
;;;   ...)
;;;
;;; Patterns are composed of the following objects:
;;;
;;; * the symbol _ matches and ignores any object
;;; * quoted symbols match equal symbols
;;; * strings match equal strings
;;; * numbers match equal numbers
;;; * lists match lists of the same size, if their elements match
;;; * improper lists allow the tail of a list to be matched 
;;; * unquoted symbols match any object and are bound to the value in the body
;;;
;;; TODO - support equality testing, when a name is used more than once?
;;; TODO - support regex patterns for matching/decomposing strings
;;; TODO - support arbitrary predicates (like the 'if' in Erlang and Scala)
;;; TODO - support symbols with name "_" from any package as wildcard?
;;; TODO - think harder about how to chop up the EVAL-WHEN
